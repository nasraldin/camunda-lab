# Architecture

A Go CLI that downloads Camunda’s zip, stores it under your home directory, and runs `docker compose` with the right files plus a few thin overlays.

```text
you
 └── camunda (CLI)
       ├── camunda ui  →  http://localhost:9090  (embedded SPA + /api/v1)
       ├── ~/.camunda-lab/config.yaml
       ├── ~/.camunda-lab/ai.env            ← optional AI Agent SECRET_*
       ├── ~/.camunda-lab/versions/8.9/     ← official zip, extracted
       ├── ~/.camunda-lab/resources.env     ← heap hints
       └── docker compose -p camunda-lab -f …
             └── Camunda containers (+ overlays)
```

## Source of truth

[camunda/camunda-distributions](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-distributions) release assets:

```text
docker-compose-8.8.zip
```

We extract the zip and leave Camunda’s OIDC / Keycloak wiring alone. If Camunda fixes a bug in the zip, the next fetch picks it up.

## What we add

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Version adapters | Map `light` / `full` / `modeler` → the right compose file per minor |
| `resources.env` | Heap hints + `KEYCLOAK_HOST=keycloak` for container→Keycloak on full |
| `elasticsearch-8.10.yaml` | Sidecar ES when full profile on 8.10 needs it |
| `elasticsearch-cors.yaml` + `elasticvue.yaml` | CORS + ElasticVue when host ES is published |
| `http-headers.yaml` | Larger Tomcat header limit so full-profile SSO cookies don’t 400 |
| `connectors-ai-secrets.yaml` + `ai.env` | Opt-in AI Agent `SECRET_*` (`camunda ai`) |
| MCP URLs / `camunda ai config` | Surface `/mcp/cluster` (+ `/mcp/processes` on 8.10+); client JSON |
| Lab UI (`camunda ui`) | Embedded local SPA on loopback; same lab packages via `/api/v1` |
| doctor / wait / smoke | Docker sanity and “are the UIs answering?” |
| tools helpers | Point `c8ctl` / Desktop Modeler at this lab |

## Compose project name

Everything runs under project name **`camunda-lab`**, so it doesn’t collide with a random `docker compose up` from a hand-extracted zip.

## Not in scope

- Replacing Helm
- Multi-instance named labs (paths are shaped so we can add that later)
- Rewriting Camunda’s service graph
